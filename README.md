## A few downloads: 
[Qbittorrent](https://www.fosshub.com/qBittorrent.html) This is what we are going to use to download our files. Subjectively the best. If you don't like it, Google away! Just search "Torrent clients" You will surely find a one you like.

[7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) A program that is used to compress and uncompress files.

[Ublock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) Any ad blocker you can gets your hands on. Here is one I use for Chrome.

I am downloading "Better Call Saul" using [1337x.to](https://1337x.to). 

I want to download Season 4 Episode 7. So I am going to type: Better Call Saul S04E07

If it was Season 3 Episode 2 for example it would be: Better Call Saul S03E02

Now it will list many results depending on the search. You need to select your video quality.(2016p,1080p,720p). Also look at the green and red numbers on the rigth side of the results name.
