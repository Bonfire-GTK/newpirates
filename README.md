# Torrenting for Beginners
This guide is extremely simplified.

## CTRL+Left Click to open a link in a new tab. (colored blue)

## A few downloads: 
[qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php) This is what we are going to use to download our files. Subjectively the best torrent client.

[uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) Any ad blocker you can get your hands on. uBlock Origin is subjectively the best. [(Firefox Link)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)

## Downloading Games With Torrents
I am downloading "Doom Eternal" using [fitgirl-repacks.site](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/). 

Click the search icon at the top right and search the game you want. Click the game you want to download. 

Under the "Download Mirrors" section click the first "[magnet]" and then "Open qBittorent". When you get to qBittorent press "OK" and you will start downloading!

When the download finishes, right click on the torrent and select "Open Destination Folder". Click on "Setup.exe" and install. Let it finish and you are done!

## Downloading TV Shows/Movies With Torrents
I am downloading "Better Call Saul" using [1337x.to](https://1337x.to). 

I want to download Season 4 Episode 7, so I am going to type: Better Call Saul S04E07

If it was Season 3 Episode 2 for example it would be: Better Call Saul S03E02

Now it will list many results depending on the search. You need to select your video quality.(2160p,1080p,720p). Also look at the green and red numbers on the right side of the results. If the red number is close or higher than the green number don't download that torrent, because it will download slowly. Click on the one you want to download. Click "Magnet Download" marked Green, then "Open qBittorent". When you get to qBittorent press "OK" and it will start downloading!

When the download finishes, right click on the torrent and select "Open Destination Folder". Click on the video file. Enjoy!
